# Agentic AI: Features and Workflow

This document outlines the features and operational workflow of the agentic AI assistant.

## 1. Introduction

An agentic AI is a system designed to proactively achieve goals by taking a sequence of actions. Unlike traditional models that simply respond to prompts, an agentic AI can interact with an environment using a set of tools to accomplish complex, multi-step tasks. This assistant is a software engineer agent with extensive knowledge of programming languages, frameworks, and best practices.

## 2. Core Features

The assistant is equipped with a range of features that enable it to function as a capable software development partner:

-   **Tool Use:** The agent can utilize a variety of tools to interact with the user's development environment. This includes:
    -   Reading and writing files (`read_file`, `write_to_file`).
    -   Making targeted code changes (`replace_in_file`).
    -   Executing command-line instructions (`execute_command`).
    -   Listing files and directories (`list_files`).
    -   Asking for clarification (`ask_followup_question`).

-   **Multi-step Task Execution:** Complex problems are broken down into smaller, manageable steps. The agent executes these steps sequentially, using the outcome of one step to inform the next.

-   **Environment Awareness:** The agent receives context about the current working directory, visible files, and operating system. This allows it to make informed decisions and tailor its actions to the specific environment.

-   **Interactive Problem Solving:** When a task is ambiguous or requires more information, the agent can ask the user clarifying questions to ensure the goal is well-understood before proceeding.

-   **Code Generation and Modification:** The agent can write new code from scratch, modify existing code to fix bugs or add features, and refactor code to improve its structure and quality.

## 3. Workflow

The agent follows a systematic workflow to handle user requests:

1.  **Task Analysis:** Upon receiving a task, the agent first analyzes the user's prompt and any provided context (like file contents or environment details) to fully understand the objective.

2.  **Planning:** The agent formulates a high-level plan, breaking the task into a logical sequence of actions. This plan is flexible and can be adapted as new information becomes available.

3.  **Tool Selection:** For each step in the plan, the agent selects the most appropriate tool from its available toolset. For example, to fix a small bug, it will choose `replace_in_file` over `write_to_file` to minimize unintended changes.

4.  **Execution and Observation:** The agent executes the chosen tool. The result of this action—whether it's the content of a file, the output of a command, or feedback from the user—serves as an observation.

5.  **Adaptation:** The agent analyzes the observation.
    -   If the action was successful and the plan is still valid, it proceeds to the next step.
    -   If the action failed or produced an unexpected result, the agent adapts its plan. This may involve debugging the issue, trying an alternative tool, or asking the user for help.

6.  **Completion:** Once all steps are successfully completed and the goal is achieved, the agent uses the `attempt_completion` tool to present the final result to the user.

## 4. Example Scenario: Debugging the Pie Chart

The recent task of debugging the trading bot's pie chart serves as a practical example of this workflow:

1.  **Initial Task:** The user reported that a pie chart was not grouping small slices correctly.

2.  **Hypothesis & Action:** The agent hypothesized the data processing logic was flawed.
    -   **Tool:** `read_file` to inspect `ui_components.py`.
    -   **Tool:** `replace_in_file` to add aggregation logic for small slices.

3.  **Observation & Adaptation:** The user reported the fix didn't work. The agent then hypothesized that the summary table below the chart was inconsistent with the chart, causing confusion.
    -   **Tool:** `replace_in_file` to update the summary table to use the same grouped data.

4.  **Observation & Adaptation:** The user reported a new, more specific issue: all chart slices showed "11.1%".
    -   **Hypothesis:** The demo data must be incorrect.
    -   **Action (Debugging):** The agent used `replace_in_file` to change the hardcoded demo data to a new, distinct dataset to see if the chart would change.

5.  **Observation & Adaptation:** The user reported the chart was *still* unchanged.
    -   **Conclusion:** This proved that the `render_demo_portfolio` function was not the source of the chart being displayed. The code being edited was not the code being executed.
    -   **Action (Further Debugging):** The agent used `replace_in_file` one last time to add a "DEBUG" prefix to the chart's title, to confirm if the chart rendering function was being called at all.

This iterative process of hypothesizing, acting, observing, and adapting is central to the agent's problem-solving capability.

## 5. Conclusion

The agentic AI assistant is a powerful tool that combines language understanding with the ability to take concrete actions. By following a structured workflow and leveraging a versatile toolset, it can tackle complex software development tasks, from initial creation to intricate debugging.
